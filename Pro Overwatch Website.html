		   <p>The entire ranking system goes from 5000 point which in the highest you can be, to 1 point which is the lowest you can be. Every game you win you gain points depending on how much of an impact you had on the game. The same thing goes if you lose a game but this time you lose points instead of gaining them. Once you get to a certain amount of points you rank up.</p>

		   <h2>Bronze</h2><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/8/8f/Competitive_Bronze_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023401"><div class="transbox"><p>This is the lowest rank in the game. To be at this rank you have to be between 1-1500. I suggest you don't shoot for this rank. If you are in this rank you are considered bad. I sugest you work on calling out plays, positioning and grouping up</p>
		   </div>
           
		   <p class="silver">Silver</p><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/f/fe/Competitive_Silver_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023740"><div class="transbox"><p>This rank is the second lowest rank. It's skill rating is from 1500SR to 2000SR. This rank is for people who still don't know what team work is. My sugestion is to again just like in bronze to work on calling out the play. Fo example, if you see a reaper flanking your whole team and they are not aware, TELL THEM. That reaper is probably looking to use his ultimate. If you can stop him, you're at a huge advantage. Team comps are extreamly important as well. Just remember that having one tank is not bad, as long as you have two supports as well.</p>

		   <h3>Gold</h3><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/4/44/Competitive_Gold_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023755"><div class="transbox"><p>When you make it to the rank gold, it means your bad but you could still easily get out of it. Out of every rank in the game, this is the easist one. The main thing you want to focus on, is team play. You need to co-ordinate an attack with your team. You tell your team which way you guys are going in and how you are going to intiate the attack. Once you've figured that out, you need to focus a target. The first people you prioritize are the supports. They are extreamly vulnerable. Once you've killed them you clean up and hopefully win on that attack.</p> 
		   </div>
		   
		   <h4>Platinum</h4><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/e/e4/Competitive_Platinum_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023807"><div class="transbox"><p>Now, this is literaly the worst rank in the entire game. Everyone thinks they're a God, people through games, and you very rarly get competent team mates. First step into getting out of Platinum is to NOT main a DPS hero. If you do you wll be a platinum pleb forever.</p>

		   <h5>Diamond</h5><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/3/3f/Competitive_Diamond_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023818"><div class="transbox"><p>In Diamond, people are a lot more competent. They understand the definition of filling. Some people are still going to act like platniums, espesially in low Diamond. All you need to do is not be toxic to other players, focus key targets that your hero specifically counters and try your best.</p> 
		   </div>
		   
		   <h2>Master</h2><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/5/50/Competitive_Master_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023832"><div class="transbox"><p>In Master's there are a lot more toxic people than you'd think. Communication is key. If you still don't have a mic, just don't play the game. Everything in Masters can go smoothly or horribaly. Think of what you're going to do in the next fight, listen to your surroundings. Make sure no one is sneeking up on you. Call out what ults your team has and bring up combinations that can potentially win you the next fight. Lastly do the same tips I gave you in Diamond.</p>

		   <h6>GrandMaster</h6><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/c/cc/Competitive_Grandmaster_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161122023845"><div class="transbox"><p>Personally I have never been there so I can't say what to do better but, whatever pro's are doing just try to copy them.</p>
